    "The HHL algorithm consists of several building blocks. One of the most important ones is the phase estimation algorithm, which is being used to extract the eigenvalues of a matrix.\n",

    "## The HHL algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "First we will see a small example of the HHL, which is also runnable on the IBM quantum devices. You will see how the QPE can solve linear equations &mdash; together with another building block, the inversion of eigenvalues.  \n",
