# QISKit ACQUA - Examples

This folder contains a number of example json input files that can be loaded and run by the QISKit ACQUA
[GUI](../README.md#gui) or run by the [command line](../README.md#command-line) tool.

## Jupyter Notebook

The folder contains some Jupyter Notebook examples. If you are running directly off a clone of this repository
then on the command line, where you run 'jupyter notebook' to start the server, first change directory
to make this examples folder the current directory. This way the notebooks here will be able to find the
python code in the other folders here (via paths.py which the notebooks include)
