# External library DRIVER used for electronic structure computation.
# The DRIVER section is named here and that section should contains the
# molecule and any additional configuration needed such as basis set
# in order that a computation can be run with one and two electron
# integrals being extracted from the driver's result.

&DRIVER

# -- Molecule and config in driver specific format
# Configuration supported here is a subset of the arguments
# as can be passed to PySCF pyscf.gto.Mole class namely:
#   atom (str only), unit, charge, spin, basis (str only)
#   max_memory may be specified here to override PySCF default
#     and should be specified the same way i.e in MB e.g 4000 for 4GB
