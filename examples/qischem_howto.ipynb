The operator line would default but I have added it here to show it and to say that this is where the problem is converted into a quantum qubit form. We then have a VQE algorithm, using the COBYLA optimizer with a UCCSD variatonal form and initial state of HartreeFock. VQE is Variational Quantum Eigensolver and as its name suggests uses a variational method to find the mimimum eigenvalue of the problem, which in this case is the ground state energy of the molecule."
