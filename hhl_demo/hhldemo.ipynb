To exponentiate a matrix, that is not diagonal, two different modes can be used in Qiskit to expand the matrix and therefore calculate the approximate exponentiation. The modes are called 'suzuki' and 'trotter' and we have to decide which one to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "For both modes the number of time slices has to be defined as well. The more time slices we use the exacter the exponentiation gets. The drawback is the increase in circuit length, which is proportional to the execution time and also increases error rates if executed on a real quantum device.\n",

    "The basic idea was to precalculate the rotation values and to map them to the corresponding bit patterns. Furthermore we decided to only include a certain bit length after the most significant bit, which is set to 1, which reduces the number of gates needed. For a complete eigenvalue register length of 8 and a chosen bit length of 5, the maximum difference between the calculated and the real rotation value is about 1 %.\n",

    "__2. Generated Circuits Method:__\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper \"Design Automation and Design Space Exploration for Quantum Computers\" by M. Soeken et. al (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00631.pdf) they synthesized arithmetic circuits to calculate the reciprocal of a number stored in qubit register by using classical design automation flows and tools. The circuits are optimized for number of qubits. The basic idea was to automate the generation of the long division of a binary number. We are reusing these circuits generated with Verilog and Revs to store the reciprocal in an extra register and afterwards making the controlled rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "__3. Long Division:__\n",
    "\n",
    "The long division method used for the generated circuits can also be implemented directly. This has the advantage that the circuits can be scaled as needed, as for the generated circuit method for every bit size a new file is needed. The resulting precision can also be chosen, since, if the division leaves a remainder, the next division step can be calculated as well, so the resulting register gets longer and more accurate.\n"

This register can then be reused or read out with the help of some operator. The operator is needed to reduce the needed information to only a few features, as otherwise the speedup of the algorithm would be redundant.\n",
