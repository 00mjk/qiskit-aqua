Aqua bundles methods to find Eigenvalue of a given matrix, such as :ref:`QPE` in the Eigs library.
Rather than being used as a standalone algorithm, the members of the library are to be used in a larger algorithm such as :ref:`HHL`. The following methods are available 

- :ref:`qpe`: Given a matrix and a linear combination of its eigenstates, *qpe* prepares the Eigenvalues on a specified output register. 


.. topic:: Extending the Eigs Library

    Consistent with its unique  design, Aqua has a modular and
    extensible architecture. Algorithms and their supporting objects, such as optimizers for quantum variational algorithms,
    are pluggable modules in Aqua.
    New eigenvalue solver  are typically installed in the ``qiskit_aqua/algorithms/components/eigs`` folder and derive from
    the ``Eigenvalues`` class.  Aqua also allows for
    :ref:`aqua-dynamically-discovered-components`: new optimizers can register themselves
    as Aqua extensions and be dynamically discovered at run time independent of their
    location in the file system.
    This is done in order to encourage researchers and
    developers interested in
    :ref:`aqua-extending` to extend the Aqua framework with their novel research contributions.
