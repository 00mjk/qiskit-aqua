===========
Reciprocals
===========

Aqua bundles methods to invert a fixed-point number prepared in a quantum register in the Reciprocals library.
Rather than being used as a standalone algorithm, the members of the library are to be used in a larger algorithm such as :ref:`HHL`. The following methods are available 

- :ref:`lookup`

- :ref:`gencircuit`

- :ref:`longdivision`

.. _lookup:

---------------------
Partial Table Look Up
---------------------

.. topic:: Declarative Name

   When referring to LookUp declaratively inside Aqua, its code ``name``, by which Aqua dynamically discovers and loads it, is ``LOOKUP``.

.. _gencircuit:

--------------------------
Generated Circuit Division
--------------------------

.. _longdivision:

-------------
Long Division
